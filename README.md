# DataChallenge-SNCB-NMBS

## Challenge Overview

The task involves using statistics and machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze real-life railway vehicle data. The goal is to contribute to maintenance processes and improve the reliability of railway services on a nationwide scale.

## Data Source

Modern railway vehicles are equipped with sensors on key subsystems, including:

- Pantographs
- Traction converters
- Doors
- HVAC
- ETCS

These sensors transmit states or combinations of states as tokens (information or fault codes) to a cloud service via a cellular network.

## Main Objectives

### 1. Scenario Identification
Identify sub-sequences of events (patterns) that are strongly associated with specific incident types.

### 2. Incident Prediction
Build a model to automatically predict incident types based on new sequences of events.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Techniques for classification and prediction
- **Statistics**: Data analysis and pattern identification
- **Python**: For data processing and model building
